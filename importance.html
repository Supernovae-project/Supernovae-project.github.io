            <h4>Life on Earth</h4>
            <p>
              Life on Earth would not be possible without the existence and abundance of many
              different elements some of which are heavier than those which can be produced by
              low to intermediate mass stars. Supernova shoot out many of the heavier elements
              produced by high mass stars such as iron, oxygen and nitrogen all of which are
              vital to life on Earth.<sup onclick="source('bennet')">Source</sup>

              However, a recent study by Danish scientist Professor Henrik Svensmark
              has concluded that supernovae may also be correlated with increasing biodiversity
              on Earth. Svensmark's research matched fossil data
              with astronomical history of when the Sun was closer to parts of the Milky Way where
              Supernovae are more common. In Svensmark's conclusions, when the Sun was closer to
              supernovae-common regions, biodiversity increased. His reasoning is that cold climates
              are associated with high supernovae rates and this brought a greater variety of habitats
              on Earth leading to greater evolutionary experimentation.<sup onclick="source('massey')">Source</sup>

                Type Ia Supernovae are both very common and very consistent in the
                amount of energy released during an explosion. Because of this, they
                are very useful for scientists to measure cosmic distances and therefore
                better understand the relative location of other galaxies, solar systems,
                and stars from Earth.<sup onclick="source('nave')">Source</sup>

              <p> This also gives scientists evidence to explain that the universe is
                expanding at an increasing rate.<sup onclick="source('may')">Source</sup>

                High mass stars are very important to the universe's elemental diversity because
                their high mass cores create greater temperatures and thus can fuse heavier elements
                than low-mass stars.<sup onclick="source('bennet')">Source</sup> However, these elements remain concentrated in the high mass star.
                Supernovae play a key role in expelling these elements away from the star and distributing
                elements through interstellar space thus increasing the possibilities for wanderers in space.

              <p>Scientists now believe that a supernova explosion was very important in the creation
                of our solar system. Recent research has said that shock waves from a supernova explosion may have condensed
                portions of the solar nebula that was the parent of our solar system. Additionally, the supernova
                may have brought with it new heavier elements originally not found in the nebula. Evidence for this
                theory was found when analyzing radioactive isotopes from meteorites.<sup onclick="source('choi')">Source</sup>
