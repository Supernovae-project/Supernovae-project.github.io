              <p>Supernovae are massive explosions of a star that occur in one of two
                situations (see <a href="types.html">Types</a>). In the first type,
                a white dwarf accretes matter from its companion star in a binary system.
                When it accretes enough matter, it explodes in a massive burst of energy
                and it shoots a great deal of matter away. In the second type, a high-mass
                star at the end of its life is no longer able to resist the crush of gravity.
                In an instant, the core compresses into a ball of neutrons and releases
                a wave of energy that blasts away its outer layers, sending them
                into interstellar space.<sup onclick="source('bennet')">Source</sup>
                Supernovae are among the brightest events that can be witnessed in
                our universe. On this website, you will learn all about why they occur,
                why they are important, and the cutting edge research and observations
                scientists have made about them.

              <h4>Power of the Explosion</h4>
              <p>Supernovae are some of the most destructive outbursts of energy
                that have been observed in the universe. They release observable
                radio waves and x-rays<sup onclick="source('britannica')">Source</sup> as well as
                observable rays of cosmic particles such as neutrinos.<sup onclick="source('bennet')">Source</sup>
                The explosion can often times grow more luminous than its galaxy, a rather
                stellar achievement.<sup onclick="source('britannica')">Source</sup>
                A more visual way of understanding how powerful these explosions are is
                looking at what remains after a supernova has exploded. It will leave behind
                a Supernova remnant, a cloud of gas, that moves through interstellar space away
                from the origin of the explosion at thousands to millions of kilometers per second.<sup onclick="source('bennet')">Source</sup>
                This heated cloud of gas is visible as a nebula, for instance the <a class="link" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Crab_Nebula.jpg" >crab nebula</a>
                was born from a Supernova explosion.

              <p>
                Supernovae are interesting historically because they have been recorded
                for a long time. In 1054, Chinese and Korean observers noted a bright
                spot in the sky near the constellation Taurus. This was later recognized
                as a Supernova when scientists found the Crab Nebula in that location with a
                spinning neutron star at its center, a remnant of a Type II supernova.<sup onclick="source('britannica')">Source</sup>
                Then famously Johannes Keppler observed a visible bright spot in the sky
                in 1604 and recorded the event. This Supernova was so powerful that its remnant
                is expanding at 4 million miles per hour.<sup onclick="source('cooper')">Source</sup>
                Modern scientists however can see supernova that occur much farther away and that
                are not visible to the naked eye through the use of telescopes and observatories.

                Observational has shown that there are uniquely massive explosions in the universe
                that must be due to some circumstances. Scientists analyze these circumstances by looking
                at the spectrum released by a these explosions, allowing them to determine which elements
                and their respecitve quantities make up the observable light.<sup onclick="source('nave')">Source</sup> From this, they can
                put data into working understanding of how stars work based upon our understanding of their
                composition and how physics operates under stellar conditions. For instance, the existence of
                heavier elements in the universe at a greater than expected amount can be explained by the results
                of supernova.<sup onclick="source('britannica')">Source</sup>
