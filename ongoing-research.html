                The "Zombie Star"<sup onclick="source('parks')">Source</sup>
                is potentially a star which has had a supernova explosion more than once.
                Supernova
                iPTF14hls was observed in Sept., 2014; over the next two years
                it oscilated in brightness, which
                was both far longer than the normal 100 days of a Supernova and followed an erratic brightnes pattern.
                What made it even more interesting was that a Supernova was recorded in 1954 in the exact same
                location leading scientists to postulate it could have been the same star.<sup onclick="source('tasoff')">Source</sup>
                One theory postulates that multiple supernovae could be possible if the initial
                star was so hot and massive it formed antimatter in its core leading to unstable and unpredictable
                explosive events.<sup onclick="source('parks')">Source</sup>
                Another thought is that the event was a transfer of energy from the remaining
                neutron star's enormous magnetic field spinning at 1000 times per second.<sup onclick="source('billings')">Source</sup>

              <!--<h4>"Fake" Supernova</h4> -->
              <p>In June, 2015, scientists working on the ASASSN Project spotted
                a luminous event, which was believed to be the brightest Supernova
                ever witnessed in recorded history.
                The event was 20 times more luminous than the entire Milky Way Galaxy. <sup onclick="source('mack-supernova')">Source</sup>
                Nothing as bright had been recorded so scientists came up with different theories about
                how it could have occured. One such theory was that the event was not actually
                the Supernova's initial explosion but transfer of energy from the remaining
                neutron star's enormous magnetic field spinning at 1000 times per second.<sup onclick="source('billings')">Source</sup>
                However, a new theory suggests that the event was caused by a tidal disruption
                when a very high mass star was torn apart by a supermassive black hole.<sup onclick="source('mack-black')">Source</sup>

              <!--<h4>Betelgeuse Goes Supernova?</h4>-->
              <p>
                Betelgeuse is the nearest star in our sky likely to go supernova. It is already
                one of the brightest stars in the sky and its proximity and its age means that
                it could potentially explode in our lifetime. If it does it will be the brightest
                object during the night, perhaps even brighter than the moon according to some
                scientists, and it will be visible in that state for more than a year.
                Why can't we tell when it will go supernova? The main problem is that scientists
                do not have the potential currently to detect neutrinos at the distance
                Betelgeuse is from Earth.<sup onclick="source('siegal')">Source</sup>
